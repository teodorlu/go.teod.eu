# Learning by doing: this folder is experimental

- This folder is for experimentation
- It's okay to depend on main source from experimental source
- It's not okay to depend on experimental source from main source.
- Files in this folder may be deleted at any time.
  If that happens, the main app shall not crash.

In other words: consider the namespaces here disposable, and for education purposes only.
